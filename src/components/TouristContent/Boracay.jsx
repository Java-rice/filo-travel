      <h1>1. White Beach, Boracay - The Pearl of the Pacific</h1>
      <img src={BoracayImg} alt="Boracay"></img>
      <p>
        White Beach in Boracay is a world-class destination known for its
        approximately 4 km stretch of powdery white sand that stays cool even in
        hot weather and its crystal blue waters, making it a picturesque
        paradise for visitors. The beach offers a stunning and captivating
        experience, with ample space for sunbathing, leisurely strolls, and

      <p>
        To cater to different preferences in ambiance, activities, and budget,
        ensuring there is something for everyone, White Beach in Boracay is
        divided into three sections:
      </p>
      <h2>Station 1: Quiet Luxury</h2>
      <p>
        Station 1 is located at the northern end of White Beach and is known for
        its quieter atmosphere and upscale resorts. It is home to iconic
        landmarks like Willy's Rock and the row of blue-sailed paraw boats. The
        farther you move from Station 2, the calmer it gets, with the
        northernmost tip near Lambros Point being the most serene. However,
        Station 1 is also the poshest side of White Beach, with most properties
        on the higher end of the price spectrum.
      </p>
      <h2>Station 2: Center of Action</h2>
      <p>
        Station 2 is the epicenter of activity in Boracay. It has the largest
        concentration of hotels, resorts, bars, restaurants, and shops,
        including the popular D'Mall area. Station 2 is the most accessible,
        with most transportation services picking up, dropping off, or
        terminating around here. Almost every main point of interest is within
        walking distance. However, this accessibility and busyness can also make
        it loud and noisy at times.
      </p>
      <h2>Station 3: Budget Friendly</h2>
      <p>
        Station 3 is the farthest from Station 1 and tends to be busier and
        narrower due to more vendors. It's known for its affordable
        accommodations, making it ideal for travelers watching their budgets. If
        youâ€™re looking for a cheaper place to stay and still be close to the
        beach, Station 3 is your best bet.
      </p>
      <h2>Culture and People</h2>
      <p>
        Getting around Boracay is relaxed and easy-going, without the need to
        follow strict rituals or values. The local Boracay culture celebrates
        events like the Boracay Funboard competition, Ati-atihan festival in
        January, and dragon boat races. The locals are very friendly, loving,
        and believe in peace. Their culture is rich in dance, art, and music,
        with many children learning these from a young age.
      </p>
      <p>

        all over the world, as well as many Filipino families enjoying vacations
        and taking engagement photos. You'll hear the lyrical voices of the
